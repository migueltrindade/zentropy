INTRODUCTION
------------

Zentropy is a base theme which attempts to bring the best of a couple worlds together:

 * It converts the core template files to HTML5 markup (based on "Boron" * all credit to Scott Vandehey (spaceninja) of Metal Toad Media)
 * It adds useful features from the classic Drupal 6 "Basic" theme
 * It includes an HTMl5-friendly CSS Reset and other tweaks & best practices from Paul Irish's "HTML5 Boilerplate" (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
 * It also features a bunch of other goodies thrown in: more regions, Google Analytics integration, more htaccess tweaks, support for Modernizr (http://www.modernizr.com/) and all sorts of awesomeness

Like other minimal base themes, such as Zen, Stark and Boron, Zentropy includes only a few lines of layout-driven CSS, and markup that is search engine optimized.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BASIC, BORON AND ZENTROPY?

What really sets Zentropy apart is that apart from bringing together great ideas from both afforementioned themes, it includes all of the awesomeness from Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate for a rock-solid HTML5 starter theme.

Think of it as a fork of all 3 projects merged into one big steaming pile of awesome.
