Zentropy is a base theme which attempts to bring the best of a couple worlds together:
* It converts the core template files to HTML5 markup (based on "Boron" - all credit to Scott Vandehey (spaceninja) of Metal Toad Media)
* It adds useful features from the classic Drupal 6 "Basic" theme
* It includes an HTMl5-friendly CSS Reset and other tweaks & best practices from Paul Irish's "HTML5 Boilerplate" (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* It also features a bunch of other goodies thrown in: more regions, Google Analytics integration and all sorts of awesomeness

Like other minimal base themes, such as Zen and Stark, it includes only a few
lines of layout-driven CSS, and markup that is search engine optimized.
